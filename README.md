# mc2
A work-in-progress Minecraft clone. Uses the [New Start](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/new-start---by-loufisch/) texture pack.

Disclaimer: As mentioned above, this is a work-in-progress. It has many bugs and missing features.

Controls should be more-or-less the same as actual Minecraft.

Libraries:
* [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)
* [NoiseJS](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs)
